## ✨ Overview

This repository provides ESP-IDF examples, source for its dated factory
firmware, factory recovery images, and a schematic for the Waveshare
ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3.

The board combines an ESP32-P4 application processor with an ESP32-C6 wireless
coprocessor, a portrait 4.3-inch capacitive-touch display, audio input and
output, camera and USB interfaces, microSD storage, and a 40-pin expansion
header. It is designed for multimedia interfaces, edge applications, smart
terminals, and human-machine interaction projects.

| Hardware file | [Product schematic](schematic/ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3-schematic.pdf) |

For complete specifications, connector details, and safe operating guidance,
see the [official product documentation](https://docs.waveshare.com/ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3).
CI proves source compatibility only; hardware pin and timing validation should
also use the schematic and the board revision in hand.

### ESP32-P4 silicon profiles

The default ESP-IDF profile is `rev3_x`: it requires `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_300`
and uses 250 MHz PSRAM. Rev1.3 boards remain supported through the explicit
`config/ci/rev1_3.defaults` compatibility overlay, which selects
`CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_100` and 200 MHz PSRAM. The BSP released from
[PR #191](https://github.com/waveshareteam/Waveshare-ESP32-components/pull/191)
leaves MIPI PHY clock selection to ESP-IDF's revision-aware default; do not copy
a clock-source setting between profiles. Examples 06–12 select the published
Registry release `waveshare/esp32_p4_wifi6_touch_lcd_4_3==1.0.1`, which includes
the Rev3.x clock update and no-INT/RST GT911 address probing. A successful
compile does not validate panel timing on a physical board.

Arduino-ESP32 `3.3.11` is a separate prebuilt-core profile: its
`ChipVariant=postv3` libraries resolve to `CONFIG_ESP32P4_REV_MIN_301` and
200 MHz PSRAM. Arduino examples therefore require P4 Rev3.1 or newer; they do
not support Rev3.0 and do not use the ESP-IDF 250 MHz PSRAM profile.

## 📦 Factory Firmware

[`firmware/brookesia/`](firmware/brookesia/) contains the source snapshot for
the dated ESP32-P4 Rev3.x factory image built with ESP-IDF v5.5.5. It provides
the Brookesia launcher, ESP-Hosted Wi-Fi, camera, audio, multimedia, settings,
and Xiaozhi applications. Its local board component keeps the ST7701 panel at
500 Mbps per data lane and a 30 MHz DPI clock. It also preserves the image's
GT911 configuration: polling after probing `0x5D` then `0x14`, with reset on
GPIO23 and no interrupt input. The product examples instead use the newer
Registry BSP, which drives neither GT911 INT nor RST.

The matching 16 MiB combined image is
[`ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3-FactoryOnly-260820.bin`](firmware/ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3-FactoryOnly-260820.bin),
which is flashed at offset `0x0`. The earlier
[`ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3-FactoryOnly-260206.bin`](firmware/ESP32-P4-WIFI6-Touch-LCD-4.3-FactoryOnly-260206.bin)
remains available as an immutable recovery image. Neither image is generated
by the example workflow or treated as an ESP-IDF example artifact.

Follow the official product documentation for the required flashing tool and
recovery procedure. See the [default firmware build guide](firmware/brookesia/README.md)
to build the Rev3.x source. Compilation does not replace hardware validation.

Review each example and the official product documentation for its peripheral
and media prerequisites. CI validates compilation; it does not replace testing
on the target board and connected accessories.

## 🛠️ Continuous Integration

| Surface | Version | Default builds | Conditional builds |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| ESP-IDF | `v5.5.5` | 12 | 9 |
| ESP-IDF | `v6.0.2` | 12 | 8 |

The [ESP-IDF examples workflow](.github/workflows/esp-idf-examples.yml) discovers
the 12 direct first-party projects under `examples/esp-idf/`. A full source run
contains one preflight job and 41 build jobs: 24 defaults plus audio-echo,
RGB888, Brookesia-AI (v5.5.5 only), and USB-minimal configurations. Documentation-only changes run the
preflight without ESP-IDF builds; factory-firmware changes are reported for
release review but are never treated as example sources. Unknown paths trigger
the complete matrix, while an empty or unreadable diff fails closed. See the
[CI guide](docs/CI.md) for routing and evidence boundaries.

Successful example-CI lanes also upload a SHA-bound flash package for their
specific project, ESP-IDF version, and variant. See [CI firmware artifacts](docs/CI_FIRMWARE.md).

The Arduino examples use Arduino-ESP32 `3.3.11` with
`ChipVariant=postv3`. That core's bundled P4 configuration is Rev3.1-or-newer
with 200 MHz PSRAM, rather than the ESP-IDF Rev3.x 250 MHz profile. The ten
sketches are discovered below `examples/arduino/examples/`; the repository does
not claim onboard CAN or RS485 functionality.
